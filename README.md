## Hola ðŸ‘‹
My name is Enrique Perez and I'm currently entering my first year of college. I've been coding in JavaScript since my Junior year of high school. My first coding experience was on Roblox Studio where I quickly learned the pain of a single letter mistake breaking my entire project, since then I think I've gotten better with double-checking my code.

I'm currently working on code for an LED controller and a web project I've gotten an internship into.
I'm most proficient in JavaScript but I also know a good amount of C++, Python, HTML, and CSS.
I love working with Arduinos and ESP32<!-- -->_s_ whenever they work and I've spent, probably an unhealthy amount of money on parts and modules in order to make whatever I want.

If I were to rank my proficiency in programming languages I'd rank them as,
1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. C++

With my C++ usage residing in Arduino/ESP32 projects.

I'm currently looking for more connections as I enter college so feel free to email me at enriqueperezm56@gmail.com about opportunities you feel I'd fit in,

Que tengas un buen dÃ­a!
